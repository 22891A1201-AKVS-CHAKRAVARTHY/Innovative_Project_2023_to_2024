# Project Setup Guide

Hello there! We're excited to have you explore our project. Before diving into the code, here are some essential steps to ensure a smooth execution of the project.

## 1. Module Installation

To get started, make sure to install the required modules in your working environment by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install ssl
pip install smtplib
pip install imaplib
pip install email
pip install unidecode
```

## 2. Setting Up Credentials

The next step involves setting up your credentials in the `User_Credentials.py` module. Follow these instructions to provide your Google App Password:

### Create & Use App Passwords

**Important:** To create an app password, you need 2-step Verification on your Google Account.

1. Go to your Google Account.
2. Select Security.
3. Under "Signing in to Google," choose 2-Step Verification.
4. At the bottom of the page, select App passwords.
5. Enter a name to remember where youâ€™ll use the app password.
6. Select Generate.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the app password (a 16-character code generated on your device).
8. Select Done.

**Note:**
- If you can't find the option to add an app password, it might be because your Google Account has 2-Step Verification set up only for security keys, or you're logged into a work, school, or another organization account, or your Google Account has Advanced Protection.

**Tip:**
Usually, youâ€™ll need to enter an app password once per app or device.

## 3. Setting the Default Directory Path

After setting up your account, don't forget to provide the default directory path in the code.

## 4. Configuring Recipients

Lastly, you need to specify the recipient's list in the `Contact_List.py` module. By default, we've set the range of the number of recipients as five, but feel free to edit it based on your needs.

That's it! You're now ready to explore and run our project. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.
